h1. XXXX

<pre>
  (app ["hi"] {:get "Hello World!"})
</pre>

XXXX is a micro web framework/internal DSL to wire Ring handlers and middlewares.

h2. How micro is it?

Well there's only one macro you need to know: @app@. 

Every other public var is public only because @app@ needs it in its expansion.

h2. The @app@ macro

A @(app ...)@ form returns a Ring application (handler).

There's currently four usages of @app@:
* to wrap a Ring handler,
* to define routes,
* to dispatch on HTTP methods
* and to render plain text.

h3. Wrapping an existing Ring handler

<pre>
  (app my-handler) ; identity, returns my-handler
</pre> 

You can simply wrap an handler into middlewares:
<pre>
  (app
    middleware1
    (middleware2 arg) 
    my-handler) 
  ; equivalent to (-> my-handler (middleware2 arg) middleware1)
  ; ie (middleware1 (middleware2 my-handler arg)) 
</pre> 

Note that *every usage of @app@ supports middleware-wrapping*.
